                                                            STRUCRTURE OF MY PROJECT


First of all, I extracted data using Yelp API which is stored into food_trucks_Indiana_project.csv

Then, I imported this csv file into Travel_plan(1).ipynb Jupyter notebook, where I performed the data analysis( Tables, Pie Chart, Bar Graphs, Data Cleaning and Organizing), which is visisble as you scroll through the notebook.

Now, The Jupyter notebook creates an excel file which includes a 2-day weekend Foodie Plan for our travellers and the corresponding route map.

In the route visualisation code, I have used a Google API key, which I purchased for myself and Google does not allows to share the API key over Github. Hence, the code might give an error when executed on your end. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
